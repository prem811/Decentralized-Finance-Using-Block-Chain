# Decentralized-Finance-Using-Block-Chain
How This Project Works: 
This project operates on a blockchain platform where:
 
• A borrower submits an application with details such as their Ethereum address. 

• The lender receives an email notification, verifies the borrower, and sends ETH using their 
Ethereum address. 

• The borrower has one month to repay the loan, and upon repayment, the lender receives a 
confirmation email. 

• All transactions take place via Metamask and Ganache, using a private Ethereum network.
